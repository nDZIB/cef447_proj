To run this product:
1. Have a web server installed (xampp, wamp, lamp. but preferably xamp build 2015)
2. Clone the repository and copy the 'UNIV_WARE_APP' into htdocs folder within the installation folder for xamp. 
3. Import the 'sql_script.sql' file into a mysql database.
4. Start your local server, then navigate to 'localhost/UNIV_WARE_APP'


the repository's code is VERY DIRTY and the application is running on wrong logic. Highly needs modifications and review!!
